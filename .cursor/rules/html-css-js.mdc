# HTML, CSS, and JS Conventions

## HTML
- Use semantic elements: `header`, `main`, `nav`, `section`, `article`, `footer`.
- Set `<html lang="en">` (or correct language).
- Include `<meta charset="UTF-8">` and viewport meta for responsiveness.
- Link styles and scripts with relative paths (e.g. `css/main.css`, `js/main.js`).

## CSS
- Use `css/main.css` as the primary stylesheet; add other files as needed and link from HTML.
- Prefer CSS custom properties for colors and spacing. Use a small set of variables in `:root`.
- Use `box-sizing: border-box` (e.g. on `*` or `html`) and avoid layout surprises.
- Keep selectors specific enough to be maintainable; avoid deep nesting.

## JavaScript
- Use `'use strict';` at the top of script files.
- Prefer `DOMContentLoaded` for DOM-dependent code so scripts run after the document is ready.
- Keep JS minimal unless adding interactivity; avoid inline scripts in HTML when possible.
- Use relative URLs and paths that work from the site root on GitHub Pages.
